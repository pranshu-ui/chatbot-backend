## Summary

PLOT was founded within the Canadian STEAM Program known as SHAD Program. Known more commonly as just Shad, it is a University of Waterloo originating program where the most talented students from grade 10-11 across Canada are handpicked and sent to a volunteering University campus. The program is intensive; with up to six lectures a day, we learn about foundational business development, general sciences,  local history, and build hands-on experiences through labs, tutorials, and volunteering. 

> ***As intense as it sounds, it was honestly the most fun and life-changing experience I’ve ever been a part of!***
> 

The prospect was to leave us with a good sense of what university would feel like, build life-long connections and most importantly provide transferable professional experience. A part of building those experiences was also the highlight of Shad, the DE challenge. It was a series of lectures, presentations, and guidelines that would challenge us to create a **fully** fleshed-out and marketable ‘thing’ that would solve an issue (which was then subsequently sent to present to a panel of judges so they could dictate how well we did.)

**My Team :)** (Jason, Mazyar, Me, Alan, Milo, Audrey, Steph, Angelina, Aaron)

If you ever talk to someone who’s been to Shad, apart from being consistently super passionate about STEM, you’ll quickly come to learn that they’ve created business plans themselves. The only difference is theirs would have tackled a completely different issue. See, Shad assigns us a DE (Design Engineering) Challenges where we create a project, quite literally anything, that can solve the problem. [I believe they do this to keep it fresh so the Program Assistants don’t die from boredom.] 

## Timeline

### Problem

This year, the challenge was:

> “How might we reimagine living spaces for people in Canada in ways that increase sustainability, accessibility, and community connections?”
> 

### Define

Reading that, you might think that this question clearly wants us to create some sort of dream green living spaces you see in those futuristic movies. However, the goal was for us to target a niche that impacted that problem. This was because the issue was so grand that a group of 15 year olds would obviously struggle creating a tangible solution whereas scientists haven’t been able to figure it out for centuries. 

Defining the problem took the longest time out of the entire process. There was a great emphasis on taking our time to exactly choose the 5 W’s of exactly what we wanted to solve. First, we wanted to address homelessness because they are effected the most from changing in housing and creating a solution would be  straightforward. However, given that the solution was straightforward, the path of ideation would be boring and uninventive. 

> We were there to innovate after all.
> 

After many tireless and often hilarious debates, our group collectively decided to target accessing affordable groceries in London, Ontario. The idea was that if renters and homeowners were able to reduce their cost of living, which was mainly spent on groceries/food, they would have an easier time living a more sustainable lifestyle. Hence, the idea of Plot arose.

### Ideation

Essentially:

- **Who was our target demographic?:** Homeowners, renters, and hobbyists from age range 12-100 that want to reduce monthly grocery costs while making their interior space more lively.
- **What specific problem are we solving?:** Grocery costs every month really add up. Whether you’re raising a family or trying to manage your high-stress job, it’s hard to find time to get groceries, cook, eat, and try to save money.
- **When would this take place and under what time-frame?:** The creation would take about 6 months for all processes to get up and running. About a year and a half to see real profit.
- **Where would this take place?:** We chose London, Ontario as the city has a surplus of “Food Swamps.” These are plazas, hubs, and general locations where fast food is easier to find than groceries. People are encouraged to eat out rather than buy healthier alternatives.
- **Why are we doing this?:** The idea is that if people have more time, they can better manage their living expenses and have time to live more sustainably.
- **How would we go about doing this?:** Plot provides a simple permanent solution for a one-time payment.

### Plan

Plot scans your interior using our app, creates a custom indoor planter with plant recommendations that grow best in your area, provide care instructions, and send you notifications to take care of your plants. Using the app, you can also sell your plants to locals who can’t access further grocery stores and make a personal profit. Not to mention, our website allows for businesses and land-owners to have Plot create and install custom large-scale planters where residences can profit off of having plants on that land.


Plot’s Fully Fleshed-out Business Plan

### Prototype

INCLUDED IN THE SLIDESHOW. 

### Outcome

In the end, after our presentation and submission, we won the “Best Business Plan” Award which highlighted our overall plan as the most well-thought out, innovative, and realistic.

Plot’s Presentation used in Competition 


> What began as an idea for a small science fair at my high school quickly gained traction, growing beyond my wildest expectations.
> 

Here’s the background: at the end of grade 11, I discovered the Niagara Regional Science Fair. Attending this event was mesmerizing—hundreds of passionate young minds focused on solving problems through science. Despite the inspiring atmosphere, I felt a pang of frustration. Growing up in Niagara for 12 years, I had never heard of this fair. As a science enthusiast, I was disheartened that the regional science fair committee hadn’t actively engaged Niagara Falls high schools. I knew my peers and I would have jumped at the opportunity to participate. Motivated, I decided to bring the fair experience directly to my school.

First, I contacted the science fair committee to discuss this issue, arranging a Zoom call with the chair. I quickly learned that the committee did send flyers to all schools in Niagara, but it was up to each school to inform students. Since my school, Westlane, lacked the resources to promote the fair or support student attendance, the chair suggested that I start a smaller, in-school fair to showcase the value directly.

Energized by the idea, I immediately began planning. I mapped out a year-long schedule, covering fundraising, committee formation, event logistics, and key dates. As a student council member, I made sure to avoid conflicts with other school events.

The slideshow I presented to my Principal

After gaining approval, I quickly realized our limited resources as a small school would be a hurdle. To address this, I reached out to the mayor, who connected me with the Director of the city’s Innovation Hub.

During a Zoom call with the Director, I presented my plan, explaining what the Hub could provide and what it would gain in return. Impressed by the idea, he invited me for an in-person tour of the Hub to discuss further.

> Let’s just say I was ECSTATIC.
> 

I cleared my schedule for the tour, and entering the Hub was a thrill. The building was four floors of high-tech offices and amenities, plus four underground floors dedicated to innovation spaces—labs, 3D printing stations, a greenhouse, and even a podcast studio. Each area was leased to major businesses, yet I was given access to all these resources for free, in exchange for promoting the initiative within the region.

> We had a deal!

Excitedly, I emailed my principal, but her response was a blow: Westlane couldn’t support the club, as they’d be required to provide transportation to the Hub, which wasn’t feasible during a bus driver shortage.

After discussing this with my science teacher, he suggested I make it a city-wide youth club, open to students from any high school who could manage their own transport to the Hub.

Glad to have his support, I adjusted my plan. The club was open to any student in the city willing to meet at the Hub 2-3 times a week. With access during Hub hours, we scheduled sessions to monitor project progress and ensure safety.

I marketed the club citywide—at the YMCA, both major libraries, and through friends on the Youth Advisory Committee. Within two weeks, we had 12 students and 8 mentors (previous fair participants) on board.

Over a busy two months, we supported eight different, innovative projects, ranging from aquaponics systems that recycle fish waste to fertilize plants, to using moss for water filtration.

In the end, all our project teams participated in the fair, with two receiving awards from generous donors for their outstanding work.

## Background

It all started when I got a 3D printer for my birthday. The sleek, futuristic machine sat on my desk, humming with potential, yet I had only the faintest idea of what to do with it. Armed with YouTube tutorials and endless reddit forums, I ventured into the world of 3D printing.

The learning curve was steep at first. I couldn’t even print a basic gear without misalignments, and filament jams seemed to happen every time I tried something new. But I kept at it, tinkering with Cura Settings, troubleshooting the printer, and learning about the intricacies of slicing software and filament types. After a while, I started creating small objects—a keychain here, a Batarang there. That’s when the idea struck: I could turn this into a business.

Marketing was a whole other challenge. 

> How do you convince people they need something they can’t quite picture yet?
> 

I started small, posting examples of my creations on social media and joining local Facebook groups. It was slow at first, but I didn’t give up. I researched marketing strategies and revamped my posts, showing not just the products but also the process, which sparked curiosity.

Soon, local businesses and individuals started reaching out, intrigued by what custom 3D printing could offer them. I worked with a restaurant to make them menu holders, printed a custom foldable guitar stand for a travelling musician, to even designed a statuette for my best friend. Each project taught me more about my printer, my materials, and what I could accomplish with some creativity.

By the end of the summer, Aurelius Tech had built a reputation in the area. The experience was a whirlwind of challenges, but each one left me with new skills and a deeper understanding of what 3D printing could do—not just for me but for the people around me.

Here are some projects I made- Unfortunately at the time I would sell them, I would forget to take pictures but here are the files!

## First Project - Batarang Stand

This project was my very first one.

I was fascinated by the idea of custom-printed designs, so I set out to create a decorative batarang with a matching display stand. This project was a crash course in extrusion techniques, chamfering, and understanding the precise tolerances needed for additive manufacturing. Some sharp angles initially made the print impossible, while others were too wide and looked unsatisfactory. After multiple test prints and tweaks, the batarang finally came out just right.

The holder was another challenge entirely. I had to get the dimensions just right and balance the weight to ensure it wouldn’t tip over. Designing it in 3D modelling software, I experimented with custom planes, extrusion cuts, curved surfaces, and weight distribution for hours on end.

In the end, the hours were definitely worth it. I gained valuable insight into modelling techniques and print optimization, which later proved essential when working with actual clients.

## Custom Aang Statuette

Admittedly, I can’t take full credit for this project. A friend who’s skilled with Blender helped by adjusting the joints of a pre-made character model so it would be ready for printing.

This print presented some serious challenges. My printer struggled with it, and I had to reprint the statuette three times to achieve a clean result. It was my first experience working with structural supports on a complex, multi-polygon object. I had to dive into settings, carefully aligning the model on the build plate to minimize filament use while ensuring a precise print. This also meant configuring support types—from filament trees to straight supports—and learning which worked best for specific areas.

Through trial and error, I found that setting the main build at 30% infill and the supports at 15% for large overhangs, like the legs, helped reduce warping and made cleanup easier. Adjusting the speed to 80 mm/s for the main build and 300 mm/s for the supports also kept everything solid. Additionally, I sanded and sprayed the finished product for a smoother look.

## Popup Wallet

One of my favorite projects was creating a 3D-printed pop-up wallet. This build taught me a lot about functional design, particularly the importance of tight tolerances and precise measurements for moving parts. 

The initial challenge was getting the dimensions right so the wallet could snap open and close smoothly without being too loose or too tight. It took several iterations, but through trial and error, I honed in on the perfect balance. I learned about layering techniques to strengthen thin walls without adding bulk and used different infill patterns to keep the wallet light yet sturdy. With his particularly thin design that didn’t need supports, a line infill worked best.

The hinge mechanism was a whole new challenge. At first, I experimented with flexible points and the springy properties of the filament to create a self-locking feature that would keep the wallet securely closed. This meant fine-tuning temperatures and speeds to achieve the right flexibility without causing warping or weak spots.

But, with limited filament, I had to pivot to a more creative, "ooga-booga" solution. I redesigned the card holder with strategic slits and used a transitional fit to keep cards secure. The main mechanism could be operated with a thumb slider on the outside, which would pop the cards up in a satisfying, staircase pattern, thanks to the unique shape of the twisting mechanism inside.

After assembling and testing, I finished by smoothing the surface and adding a light coat for durability. This project helped me understand mechanical movement in 3D prints and gave me the skills to apply functional design principles to future client projects.

## Foldable Guitar Stand

One of my more ambitious projects was designing a foldable guitar stand. Not to mention, it was my first client project, so I was beyond ecstatic to work on it. This build challenged me to think practically about stability, weight distribution, and portability.

The initial hurdle was creating a foldable frame strong enough to support the weight of a guitar while staying lightweight and compact. I experimented with different joint types, aiming for a design that could collapse neatly but lock securely when open. The joints needed to hold steady without any wobbling, which meant adjusting tolerances down to the millimeter to get the snap-fit just right.

The support arms for the guitar required careful consideration. I tested various angles to ensure the guitar could rest comfortably without tipping over, even with a slight nudge. To add more durability, I reinforced the stress points by increasing infill around the joints while keeping the frame’s main body lighter to reduce the overall weight.

A big lesson here was optimizing for ease of assembly and portability. After a few redesigns, I created a version where the stand could slide into 3 parts flat, making it easy to pack or carry around. This project taught me valuable skills in structural integrity and modular design, which I applied to future client projects with more confidence.

Joining Waterloo Rocketry was a major highlight for me. I’d been following their achievements on LinkedIn for months, getting hyped with every update and milestone they shared. So, when I got the chance to join their team, especially as part of the propulsion group, it felt like a huge step forward. Every week, I'm learning something new and diving deeper into the mechanics behind high-power rocketry, especially in areas like thrust generation and nozzle design.

Being on the propulsion team has given me hands-on experience in SolidWorks, AutoCAD, MATLAB, and machining—skills I’m excited to bring to a professional engineering role. I’ve been learning SolidWorks to create precise 3D models, AutoCAD for technical drawings, and MATLAB for data analysis, all of which are essential for our test stand and motor designs. Additionally, I’ve been learning machining techniques to fabricate parts for our rockets, gaining firsthand experience with tolerances and material selection that goes beyond the classroom.

> Machining is way harder than I thought. I have great respect for the machinists out there.
> 

As part of the team, I’m contributing to developing high-performance propulsion systems, collaborating with other, mostly older and smarter, engineering students who push me to think critically and innovatively. The project’s complexity has taught me the importance of cross-functional teamwork, meticulous design testing, and data-driven improvements. It’s rewarding work, and I’m excited to translate these technical skills and hands-on experiences to an engineering role where I can make a tangible impact.
